    This is a game I made around December 2018.
                I have fond memories of me and my friends playing the game,
                but it fell off the web by the end of 2019,
                so I've dug up the files and hosted it here.
   </p>
   <p>
    In case it's not clear, this is a clone of the classic arcade game
                Asteroids. You control the little blue spaceship and your goal
                is to destroy all the asteroids on the screen with your blaster,
                while avoiding hitting them directly.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Left and right arrow (or A/D) rotate the ship.
    </li>
    <li>
     Up and down arrows (or W/S) move your ship forwards &amp; backwards.
                    (The screen wraps around at the edges.)
    </li>
    <li>
     Space (or X) shoots a bullet.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Mouse controls can also be used. In this case, the ship always points
                toward the cursor, so you don't need to turn it with the keyboard.
   </p>

    There are some collectible powerups that temporarily make the game easier:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The light blue clock ("timeStop") causes time to slow down, making
                    it easier to maneuver around asteroids and shoot your blaster.
    </li>
    <li>
     The red one ("aimbot") makes your lasers magically hit
                    their targets more easily.
    </li>
    <li>
     The yellow one ("scatter") makes your bullets more destructive.
                    They skip all the intermediate steps of asteroid destruction,
                    reducing a large asteroid down to its smallest parts.
                    (With six years' hindsight, I think this powerup is really usually not
                    a net benefit, since it makes the playfield more chaotic.)
    </li>
    <li>
     The mossy green one ("tripleBullet") makes you fire three bullets at once.
    </li>
    <li>
     The orange one ("repel") gives you a force field that repels asteroids.
    </li>
    <li>
     The bright green one gives you an extra life.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Enabling cheats provides some additional features:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     P queries you for a powerup name and gives it to you.
    </li>
    <li>
     L continuously spawns small asteroids on the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
     T spawns a new powerup on the screen.
    </li>
   </ul>
