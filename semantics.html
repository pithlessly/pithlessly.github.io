      <h1>Semantics and Psychology</h1>
<p><time datetime="2022-10-25">Date: 2022-10-25</time></p>
<p>What is the goal of trying to create semantics for formal systems? For the experts — people who
already have a good understanding for what statements in the system <em>should</em> mean — the goal might
be to establish rigorous knowledge about how this system works. The semantics serves to give a
deterministic translation from statements in the system being studied to some more other, more
widely understood formal system or problem space. Then we can hope that desirable properties of the
target system — being non-contradictory, being decidable, etc. — will transfer back to the
source, and we use the translation to prove it. As for the philosophical question of how we know the
target system has these desirable properties, that can be pushed off <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for beginners like myself, the goal of learning about semantics is to try to
develop this intuition for what statements in the formal system mean. Something like <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/linear+logic#game_semantics">game semantics
for linear logic</a> can be really useful in
helping to understand what the various connectives of linear logic do.</p>
<p>What makes one semantics better than another for this purpose? I think this is basically a question
of psychology. In the past, I have heard Robert Harper justify
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">constructive</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism">intuitionist</a> mathematics on the basis that, to
paraphrase, “humans have an innate evolutionary understanding of what it means to construct an
object or arrive at a conclusion by following a series of steps.” I would similarly speculate that
the reason game semantics might be helpful for learning is that humans have a deep intuition for
what it means to be in competition with an adversary, following prescribed rules.</p>
